# Artificial Intelligence Timeline

Welcome to the history of artificial intelligence! Explore key milestones in the development of AI below.

## Key Events in AI History

- **1950**: Alan Turing introduces the Turing Test, proposing a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
- **1956**: The Dartmouth Conference, organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, officially marks the birth of AI as a field of study.
- **1958**: John McCarthy develops the Lisp programming language, which becomes the dominant language for AI research.
- **1966**: ELIZA, an early natural language processing program, is created by Joseph Weizenbaum, simulating conversation through pattern matching.
- **1973**: The "AI Winter" begins, as funding for AI research declines due to unmet expectations and difficulties in solving complex problems.
- **1980**: Rise of expert systems in the corporate world, such as MYCIN, designed to diagnose infectious diseases and recommend treatment.
- **1987**: The "Second AI Winter" occurs, as interest and funding for AI declines again due to the limitations of early AI systems and a saturated market for expert systems.
- **1997**: IBM’s Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov, marking a major achievement in AI’s ability to handle complex, strategic games.
- **2006**: Geoffrey Hinton and his team at the University of Toronto demonstrate the power of deep learning, reviving interest in neural networks.
- **2011**: IBM Watson wins the quiz show *Jeopardy!*, showcasing advancements in natural language processing and AI’s ability to interpret unstructured data.
- **2012**: AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network developed by Alex Krizhevsky, wins the ImageNet competition, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition.
- **2016**: Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeats world Go champion Lee Sedol, an achievement due to the complexity of the game and the use of reinforcement learning.
- **2020**: OpenAI’s GPT-3, a language model with 175 billion parameters, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks.
- **2022**: DeepMind’s AlphaFold predicts the 3D structures of almost all known proteins, solving a 50-year-old challenge in biology.
